## The Live Show

Be ready on [`Crowdcast`][crowdcast] approximately 10-15 minutes prior to recording for a quick soundcheck.

Check the show link on your profile page on this website, this would also be sent to you through a calendar invite.

Here are some tips and tricks for a great show:

- This show records live.
- You can interact with listeners in the Crowdcast chat.
- Put your mobile device(s) on Silence and Airplane Mode.
- Have a glass of water nearby to avoid the dreaded Dry Mouth Syndrome.
- Relax. Have fun. Be yourself!

## After Recording

The hard part is over! Your episode will be professionally edited & produced. Then:

- We'll email you when your show is published.
  - We publish the video to YouTube, and audio to the website
  - Podcast aggregators take a while to refresh, usually within 24 hours, unfortunately there's little we can do about that.
- We'll all share and promote the episode!

Please do share your episode, we want to see its impact maximized. Our guests' favorite places to share their show:

- Company Website
- Personal Website, Blog, and/or Medium
- Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, etc.

## That's All!

Thanks again, we truly appreciate it! ðŸ’š
